# Assignment #4

> **Note:** Not all your project folders will be pushed to github. This is due to the `.gitignore` file in the root of this repo. This makes our projects much smaller and easier to maintain, since most of the template-y files can be auto-generated by Unity later. So folders like `Logs`, `Builds`, `Obj`, `Temp` and `Library` etc will not be pushed (which is intentional). You do not have to make any changes, just commit+push normally and git will take care of this. Just know that some of your folders(and/or files) might be missing on github even if they exist on your computer, and that is intended and is completely fine.

### Folder Structure

The entire assignment is to be done on the same Unity project, which exists in the root of this repo. 
Click `Open` in Unity Hub and select this folder to open this project in Unity. You will need to select the `Scenes` folder and click on `PartA` to open the assignment scene. 

Continue working on the assignment on Unity as you would normally do and commit + push the code using the git bash command line as specified in the `Git Fundamentals` document on nexus.
