# Unity_Uno

> The game Uno built in Unity (C#) by me with several difficulty levels of AI opponents that you can play against.


> **Note:** Not all your project folders will be pushed to github. This is due to the `.gitignore` file in the root of this repo. This makes our projects much smaller and easier to maintain, since most of the template-y files can be auto-generated by Unity later. So folders like `Logs`, `Builds`, `Obj`, `Temp` and `Library` etc will not be pushed (which is intentional). You do not have to make any changes, just commit+push normally and git will take care of this. Just know that some of your folders(and/or files) might be missing on github even if they exist on your computer, and that is intended and is completely fine.
